<p style="text-align: center;">Traffic Event Impact On Travel Time</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Data Retrevial</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In order to illustrate the relationship between the number of traffic events to the travel time on Lamar BLVD we utilized data from two APIs hosted on <a href="http://austin.data.gov" rel="nofollow">austin.data.gov.</a>&nbsp;One API contained bluetooth travel sensort data that showed the travel time and speed between various points. The second API listed traffic incident data. The bluetooth data contained a large volume of records in which we stored the data on a MySQL database. We merged the two data sets into a single data frame to illustrate correlation between traffic events and the travel time.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Analysis</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The figure below shows that as the number of incidents per day increases so does the percent increse of travel time. Also the point at which the the travel time exceeds the baseline is eleven incidents.</p>
