Has Traffic in Austin been getting worse over the years? What is the worst time to drive in Austin? And does the potential increase in traffic correlated with an increase in accidents in the city?

Below is an example of what the data looks like from TXdot API.

The graph below shows the trend of traffic density from 2014 to 2018. Using two points on I35 and Mopac we were able to calculate the traffic desity on two of Austin's major Highways. We calculated traffic density by averaging the annual daily traffic between the two points and then dividing the length between the two points. The distance between each site is about 4 miles. Looking at the figure, I35 looks like it did not increase much but when looking at the numbers the 4 miles on I35 increased by 15,000 and on Mopac, the density increased by 45,000

The next two plots below show the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) increase from 2014 to 2018. The graph on the left shows the increase of the closest counties that make up the Austin area. Hays County does not seem to make much of a change but Travis and Williamson County both increase by at least 2 to 2.6 million of cars over that time period. The graph on the right helps visualize the total AADT inrease next to the increase of AADt in Travis County.
